The implementation of a function ispartially correctwith respect to itsspecification if, assuming the precondition is true just before the function executes, then if the function terminates, the postcondition is true. The im-plementation istotally correctif, again assuming the precondition is truebefore function executes, the function is guaranteed to terminate and whenit does, the postcondition is true. Thus total correctness ispartial correct-ness plus termination.Note that if a client calls a function without fulfilling its precondition,the function can behave in any way at all and still be correct.Therefore, ifit is intended that a function be robust to errors, the precondition should include the possibility of erroneous input and the postcondition should de-scribe what should happen in case of that input (e.g. a specific exception being thrown).
